This project actually detects electromagnetic fields,
but many people believe this is how to tell if there are ghosts or spirits
around.a ghost-detecting antenna and LED
bar graph system to tell whether there is a high level of electromagnetic
activity in the vicinity. A length of bare wire acts as an
antenna to pick up an electromagnetic field within a radius of two
meters. Depending on the strength of the signal, the LEDs will light
in sequence: the stronger the signal, the more LEDs will light.
